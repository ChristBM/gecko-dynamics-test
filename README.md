# Gecko Dynamics | Test

Create a responsive web page using HTML and CSS. The page should include a header, a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer. Ensure the page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Using only CSS Grid or Flexbox, create a layout with a header, two columns (sidebar and main content area), and a footer. Ensure that the layout is flexible and adapts to different screen sizes.

Write a JavaScript function that adds a new list item to an unordered list every time a button is clicked. The function should update the list dynamically without reloading the page.
